# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems

This module will explore integrated systems that combine perception, reasoning, and action in unified frameworks. The focus will be on systems that can interpret visual information, understand natural language commands, and execute appropriate physical actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Design integrated perception-reasoning-action systems
- Implement vision-language models for robotic applications
- Create natural language interfaces for robotic systems
- Develop multimodal AI systems for humanoid robots

## Module Overview

This module will investigate integrated systems that combine perception, reasoning, and action in unified frameworks. The content will explore how modern AI techniques can be combined to create robots that can understand and respond to complex, multimodal inputs in real-world environments.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2).
