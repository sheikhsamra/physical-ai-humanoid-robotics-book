# Abstract

This academic textbook explores the intersection of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, providing comprehensive coverage of the fundamental concepts, technologies, and methodologies required to understand and develop intelligent humanoid robotic systems. The book examines how artificial intelligence algorithms can be embodied in physical humanoid forms, creating systems that can interact with and adapt to the real world through perception, reasoning, and action.

The text covers four major modules: (1) The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2), (2) Gazebo Simulation, (3) NVIDIA Isaac, and (4) Vision-Language-Action Systems. Each module builds upon the previous, creating a cohesive understanding of how modern humanoid robots are designed, developed, and deployed.

This work targets Computer Science and Robotics students with basic programming knowledge, providing both theoretical foundations and practical insights into the emerging field of Physical AI. The content maintains academic rigor while remaining accessible to students at the Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12 level, with all claims properly cited using APA (7th Edition) format.
