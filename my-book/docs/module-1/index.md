# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system, responsible for communication, coordination, and control of humanoid robots operating in physical and simulated environments. As the foundational layer for all subsequent modules, this module establishes the essential middleware concepts that enable distributed robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 as middleware for physical AI systems
- Explain ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services conceptually and practically
- Bridge Python-based AI agents to robotic controllers using `rclpy`
- Interpret and design URDF models for humanoid robots

## Module Overview

This module is structured into four chapters that progressively build understanding of ROS 2 as the communication backbone of humanoid robotics:

1. **Introduction to ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System** - Establishes the fundamental concept of middleware and why it's essential for Physical AI
2. **ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services** - Explains how robotic behaviors emerge from distributed ROS 2 components
3. **Bridging Python AI Agents with ROS 2 using `rclpy`** - Connects AI reasoning systems with physical robot control
4. **Understanding URDF for Humanoid Robots** - Explains how humanoid bodies are represented digitally for control and simulation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with distributed systems concepts (helpful but not required)

## Target Audience

This module is designed for Computer Science and Robotics students with basic programming knowledge, maintaining academic rigor suitable for peer-reviewed academic publications.
