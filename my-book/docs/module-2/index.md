# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module focuses on **digital twin concepts**, physics simulation, and environment building for humanoid robots using **Gazebo** and **Unity**. As a critical component in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum, this module bridges the gap between the communication backbone established in Module 1 (ROS 2) and the practical implementation of realistic simulation environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Explain physics simulation, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- Build high-fidelity digital environments in Unity
- Simulate sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Understand how digital twins connect simulation to real-world humanoid robotics

## Module Overview

This module is structured into four chapters that progressively build understanding of digital twin concepts in robotics:

1. **Introduction to Digital Twins** - Establishes the fundamental concept of digital twins and their purpose in humanoid robotics
2. **Physics Simulation in Gazebo** - Explores gravity, collisions, and environment setup with mapping to humanoid robot sensor outputs
3. **High-Fidelity Rendering in Unity** - Covers human-robot interaction visualization, scene setup, lighting, and environment fidelity
4. **Simulating Sensors** - Details LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, data flow into ROS 2 and AI agents, and conceptual sensor calibration

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts from Module 1
- Fundamental knowledge of robotics systems and components
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)

## Target Audience

This module is designed for Robotics and AI students with basic ROS 2 knowledge, maintaining academic rigor suitable for peer-reviewed academic publications.
