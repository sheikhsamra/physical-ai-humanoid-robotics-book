# sp.specify — Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Work inside the existing Docusaurus folder:
my-book/docs/module-3/

Do not create new folders or modify other modules.

Create 4 Docusaurus-ready Markdown chapters:
1. 01-introduction-to-nvidia-isaac.md
2. 02-isaac-sim-and-synthetic-data.md
3. 03-isaac-ros-and-vslam.md
4. 04-nav2-and-humanoid-navigation.md

Chapter focus:
- Isaac as the humanoid robot "brain"
- Photorealistic simulation & synthetic data (Isaac Sim)
- Hardware-accelerated perception & VSLAM (Isaac ROS)
- Nav2 path planning for bipedal humanoids

Constraints:
- Academic tone (Grade 10–12)
- Conceptual explanations, minimal examples
- Docusaurus frontmatter required
- Content must be RAG-ingestion ready

Prepare the reader for Module 4 (Vision-Language-Action).
```

## Response Summary

Created comprehensive specification for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The specification includes:

- 4 user stories covering Isaac platform, Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS/VSLAM, and Nav2 for humanoids
- 11 functional requirements defining the content and structure requirements
- 6 success criteria for measuring the effectiveness of the educational content
- 8 key entities related to NVIDIA Isaac and humanoid robotics education
- Quality validation checklist confirming all requirements are met

The specification was created in `specs/1-isaac-robot-brain/spec.md` with academic tone appropriate for Grade 10-12 level and follows all specified constraints including Docusaurus frontmatter and RAG-ingestion readiness.

## Outcome

Specification successfully created and ready for planning phase. The feature is well-defined with clear requirements and success criteria for Module 3 educational content about NVIDIA Isaac as the humanoid robot brain.

## Evaluation

The specification meets all requirements from the user description with appropriate academic tone and conceptual focus. The content structure prepares readers for Module 4 on Vision-Language-Action as requested.
